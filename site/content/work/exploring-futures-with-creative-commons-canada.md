In December 2019, we led a one-hour remote visioning session for Creative Commons Canada. The session was meant as an introduction to the foresight visioning process to help members begin imagining how to align their work with possible futures. Generally, this process would be conducted over a longer period or serve as a starting point for working toward an organizational strategy.

We compiled insights from the session into [this report](https://github.com/atmlutter/superorg.ca/blob/master/docs/CCCVisioningReportV1-3.pdf).

The session covered:

**Identifying Signals of Change**

_Consider changes in the following categories:_

_What is an emerging change that you have been thinking about and that you think Creative Commons Canada should be thinking about too?_

* Social
* Technological
* Environmental
* Economic
* Political
* Value-based

**Aspirational Projects**

_What is an ongoing/upcoming/aspirational project you are or would be excited to work on that you think Creative Commons Canada should be involved with?_

**Visions for a Desirable Future**

_What would extreme success look like for Creative Commons Canada in 2050?_

_Imagine it is 2050, 30 years into the future. Consider:_

* What has CC Canada achieved in the last 30 years, since 2020?
* What do CC Canada activities look like in 2050?
* What does the public think about CC Canada?
* What does your daily life look like?
